## Overview

Lightbug is a simple and sweet HTTP framework for Mojo that builds on best practice from systems programming, such as the Golang [FastHTTP](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/) and Rust [may_minihttp](https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp/).

This is not production ready yet. We're aiming to keep up with new developments in Mojo, but it might take some time to get to a point when this is safe to use in real-world applications.

Lightbug currently has the following features:
 - [x] Pure Mojo HTTP 1.1 server with no Python dependencies. Everything is fully typed, with no `def` functions used
 - [x] Cookie support

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The only hard dependency for `lightbug_http` is Mojo.
Learn how to get up and running with Mojo on the [Modular website](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo).
Once you have a Mojo project set up locally,

1. Add the `modular-community` channel to your `mojoproject.toml`, e.g:

   ```toml
   [project]
   channels = ["conda-forge", "https://conda.modular.com/max", "https://repo.prefix.dev/modular-community"]
   ```

2. Add `lightbug_http` as a dependency:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   lightbug_http = ">=0.26.1.2,<0.26.2"
   ```

3. Run `pixi install` at the root of your project, where `pixi.toml` is located
4. Lightbug should now be installed as a dependency. You can import all the default imports at once, e.g:

    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http import *
    ```

    or import individual structs and functions, e.g.

    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http.service import HTTPService
    from lightbug_http.http import HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK, NotFound
    ```

    there are some default handlers you can play with:

    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http.service import Printer # prints request details to console
    from lightbug_http.service import Welcome # serves an HTML file with an image (currently requires manually adding files to static folder, details below)
    from lightbug_http.service import ExampleRouter # serves /, /first, /second, and /echo routes
    ```

5. Add your handler in `lightbug.🔥` by passing a struct that satisfies the following trait:

   ```mojo
   trait HTTPService:
    fn func(mut self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        ...
   ```

   For example, to make a `Printer` service that prints some details about the request to console:

   ```mojo
    from lightbug_http.http import HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, OK
    from lightbug_http.header import HeaderKey

    @fieldwise_init
    struct Printer(HTTPService):
        fn func(mut self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
            print("Request URI:", req.uri.request_uri)
            print("Request protocol:", req.protocol)
            print("Request method:", req.method)
            if HeaderKey.CONTENT_TYPE in req.headers:
                print("Request Content-Type:", req.headers[HeaderKey.CONTENT_TYPE])
            if req.body_raw:
                print("Request Body:", req.get_body())

            return OK(req.body_raw)
   ```

6. Start a server listening on a port with your service like so.

    ```mojo
    from lightbug_http import Welcome, Server

    fn main() raises:
        var server = Server()
        var handler = Welcome()
        server.listen_and_serve("localhost:8080", handler)
    ```

Feel free to change the settings in `listen_and_serve()` to serve on a particular host and port.

Now send a request `localhost:8080`. You should see some details about the request printed out to the console.

Congrats 🥳 You're using Lightbug!


Routing is not in scope for this library, but you can easily set up routes yourself:

```mojo
from lightbug_http import *

@fieldwise_init
struct ExampleRouter(HTTPService):
    fn func(mut self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        if req.uri.path == "/":
            print("I'm on the index path!")
        if req.uri.path == "/first":
            print("I'm on /first!")
        elif req.uri.path == "/second":
            print("I'm on /second!")
        elif req.uri.path == "/echo":
            print(req.get_body())

        return OK(req.body_raw)
```

We plan to add more advanced routing functionality in a future library called `lightbug_api`, see [Roadmap](#roadmap) for more details.

### JSON

Use `json_decode[T]` to deserialize a request body into a typed struct, and `Json(value)` to return a JSON response:

```mojo
from lightbug_http import OK, HTTPRequest, HTTPResponse, HTTPService
from lightbug_http.http.json import Json, json_decode

@fieldwise_init
struct GreetRequest(Movable, Defaultable):
    var name: String
    fn __init__(out self): self.name = ""

@fieldwise_init
struct GreetResponse(Movable, Defaultable):
    var message: String
    fn __init__(out self): self.message = ""

@fieldwise_init
struct JsonService(HTTPService):
    fn func(mut self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        var body = json_decode[GreetRequest](req)
        return OK(Json(GreetResponse(String("Hello, ", body.name, "!"))))
```

JSON support is powered by [emberjson](https://github.com/bgreni/EmberJson).

### Serving static files

The default welcome screen shows an example of how to serve files like images or HTML using Lightbug. Mojo has built-in `open`, `read` and `read_bytes` methods that you can use to read files and serve them on a route. Assuming you copy an html file and image from the Lightbug repo into a `static` directory at the root of your repo:

```mojo
from lightbug_http import *
from lightbug_http.io.bytes import Bytes

@fieldwise_init
struct Welcome(HTTPService):
    fn func(mut self, req: HTTPRequest) raises -> HTTPResponse:
        if req.uri.path == "/":
            with open("static/lightbug_welcome.html", "r") as f:
                return OK(Bytes(f.read_bytes()), "text/html; charset=utf-8")

        if req.uri.path == "/logo.png":
            with open("static/logo.png", "r") as f:
                return OK(Bytes(f.read_bytes()), "image/png")

        return NotFound(req.uri.path)
```

## Roadmap

</div>

We're working on support for the following (contributors welcome!):

 - [x] [JSON support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/4)
 - [ ] Complete HTTP/1.x support compliant with RFC 9110/9112 specs (see issues)
 - [ ] [SSL/HTTPS support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/20)
 - [ ] [Multiple simultaneous connections](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/5), [parallelization and performance optimizations](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/6)
 - [ ] [HTTP 2.0/3.0 support](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_http/issues/8)

The plan is to get to a feature set similar to Python frameworks like [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette), but with better performance.

Our vision is to develop three libraries, with `lightbug_http` (this repo) as a starting point:
 - `lightbug_http` - Lightweight and simple HTTP framework, basic networking primitives
 - [`lightbug_api`](https://github.com/saviorand/lightbug_api) - Tools to make great APIs fast, with OpenAPI support and automated docs
 - `lightbug_web` - (release date TBD) Full-stack web framework for Mojo, similar to NextJS or SvelteKit

The idea is to get to a point where the entire codebase of a simple modern web application can be written in Mojo.

We don't make any promises, though -- this is just a vision, and whether we get there or not depends on many factors, including the support of the community.
